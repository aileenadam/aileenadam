## Hi, I'm Aileen :wave:

Welcome to my profile! I am a [senior lecturer teaching ESL](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aileenadam/) at a local university  and I love to [paint, doodle and do other artsy stuff](https://www.instagram.com/doodlingsandthings) in my free-time . This is where I will practice coding as I learn programming (python). Thanks for visiting and I'd love to [connect](aileenfarida@gmail.com)!
